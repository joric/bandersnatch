## Disclaimer

I do not own bandersnatch trademark, all rights belong to its owners and this project does not contain any copyrighted data at all.

## Setup

You have to download two json files -
[bandersnatch.json](https://gist.github.com/jonluca/860f3f445e7d84054822276fd058301a)
and
[SegmentMap.json](https://github.com/jolbol1/Bandersnatch/blob/master/SegmentMap.json),
add first lines 
(`bandersnatch=` and `SegmentMap=` accordingly), save them as *.js (html can't access json content without a server) then open html file in the browser (everything should be in the same folder).

If you're experiencing problems with local setup I recommend hosted version (just open the page and drag video file there):
* [Hosted version by mehotkhan (Bandersnatch Interactive Player)](https://mehotkhan.github.io/BandersnatchInteractive/)

* <kbd>R</kbd> - Restart video
* <kbd>→</kbd> - Jump to the next segment (or to the next interaction zone)
* <kbd>←</kbd> - Jump to the previous segment
